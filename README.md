The programs can each be run with $ ./[executable] [portnumber]
Ex. ./server 5065

The server will repeat the sentence the client has sent and send
the number of vowels back as an answer.

To end the communication ith the server, the client should type "Bye"
then hit enter.

The server will say goodbye and close the connection waiting for a
new client to connect.
